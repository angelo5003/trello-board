To start and make use of the application follow the following steps:

- fork this repo
- create a folder on your device to install the app
- once the repo is forked click on the green btn called code and copy the https link
- in the terminal use the git clone command and add the https link to it
- Once the repo is cloned open up your code editor
- Open up the terminal in your code editor, and type npm install or npm i
- Once the app is installed you can make use of the application on your localhost by typing in your code editor terminal npm start.

Things I would like to work on if I had more time:
- I want to create dynamic columns
- Add the task in the dynamic columns and let them stay in one column
- Switch the tasks from new to in progress or from in progress to done in the dynamic created columns.
- Add some more nicer styling to it.
